Hi Fish, well Wednesday came and went, I had an interview so couldn't get anything done.
However, I do already have a WIP spacestation with 8 bays on the branch where I'm doing the doing port work.

https://github.com/fluffyfreak/pioneer/tree/new4BaySpaceStation

and the folder with the max file in:
https://github.com/fluffyfreak/pioneer/tree/new4BaySpaceStation/data/models/stations/flatTop8bays

There's a MAX2013 file that has the current docking port waypoints setup within it for that station so you can see how they're currently named and used. It doesn't have doors or anything and is... well it's a bit crap :) but the waypoints are what matter! :D

When you've got some time could you take a look at what I'm doing and tell me what you think too it?
I'll briefly run down the list of waypoints but bear in mind that all of this is work in progress and might change a little over time.

Approach waypoints:
You can only have 2 of these for each bay, the 1st is far out and then 2nd is just outside the bay doors.
Naming: 
"approach_port#_stage#" - "approach_" is what identifies it in the code, "port#_" is the bay number, I might change it to "bay#_" instead of "port#_" so let me know what you think, "stage#" is either 1 or 2 for the approach waypoints. 
Approach waypoints are only used to approach the station before docking waypoints take over.

Docking waypoints:
You can have lots of these, but weirdly their numbering starts at 2 - it doesn't HAVE to be this way but it's kinda how the current Lua driven stuff works because it takes the last approach waypoint as it's first position... horrible. What do you think to me starting them at 1 and just fixing things up inside the code to hide it from the modellers?
Naming:
"docking_port#_stage#" - "docking_" is the identifier, "port#_" is the same as above, "stage#" runs from 2 (currently) upto whatever number you like! The last stage number is where it will be when it has docked, so in my model it is docked and oriented to waypoint "docking_port1_stage4".

Leaving waypoints:
You can have lots of these and they DON'T have to be the same as the docking waypoints, meaning that you could enter and leave via different routes in theory. These are conventionally number 1-N where N is a big number :)
Naming:
"leaving_port#_stage#" this is all the same format as the above explanations.
The last waypoint's orientation is MUCH more important than the rest, you have have the others cause the ship to spin, flip and pirouette if you want but the last waypoint defines what direction it will accelerate away from the station in... I had some hilarious explosions getting that bugger wrong, repeatedly! I suggest pointing it _away_ from the spacestation ;)

Naming notes:
You'll notice in my max file that there's some other text after the real named part like "_pt01", it's ignored by the code, you could write "andysmells0001" if you liked it'd still work :) I just found that when duplicating the waypoints MAX would helpfully rename the "stage1" to something like "stage02" which was not what I wanted. The extra sacrificial text just made editing easier.

Important bits:
The current waypoint is used to attach the centre of the ship, but this means that the last waypoint is always wrong for some ships and they end up sticking through the landing pad. I'm still working out how to fix this but I have only two options:
The waypoints are used to define where the bottom of the ship goes, i.e. where the wheels/feet are.
I collision test the last waypoint with the bounding box to decide when it's reached it.
I'm thinking of trying out option #2 first but be aware that I might need to use option #1, am going to try and discuss it on the mailing list to get feedback and submit a dummy Pull Request to get advice on the code etc.

Orientation is a bitch! There's two conventions to orienting the ship along the waypoints! AAAARGH! It's again because of the Lua docking code which I'm trying not to break.
I'll have to go into more detail with them in another post but take a look and have a play around. The approach orientation is different from the docking & leaving orientations.

Soon as you've had a look and got any questions or worries about it let me know!
