-- This module allows the player to hire crew members through BB adverts
-- on stations, and handles periodic events such as their wages.

-- Get the translator function
local t = Translate:GetTranslator()

-- The contract for a crew member is a table containing their weekly wage,
-- the date that they should next be paid and the amount outstanding if
-- the player has been unable to pay them.
--
-- contract = {
--   wage = 0,
--   payday = 0,
--   outstanding = 0,

	-- one is given an opportunity. At most one attribute will be improved, and
