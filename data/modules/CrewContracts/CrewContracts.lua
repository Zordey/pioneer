-- This module allows the player to hire crew members through BB adverts
-- on stations, and handles periodic events such as their wages.

-- Get the translator function
local t = Translate:GetTranslator()
local wage_period = 604800 -- a week of seconds

-- The contract for a crew member is a table containing their weekly wage,
-- the date that they should next be paid and the amount outstanding if
-- the player has been unable to pay them.
--
-- contract = {
--   wage = 0,
--   payday = 0,
--   outstanding = 0,

	-- first opportunity for improvement. The next loop actually makes it harder
	-- for the highest scoring attributes to improve, so if they fail, the next
	-- one is given an opportunity. At most one attribute will be improved, and
	-- the distribution means that, for example, a pilot will improve in piloting
	-- first, but once that starts to get very good, the other skills will start
	-- to see an improvement.
